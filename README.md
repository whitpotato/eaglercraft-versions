To download eaglercraft, its the same for all of them:
Downlaod the HTML file (In the case of the 1.12.2 file download the zip) 
After download, Open your files and find the file
Double click on the HTML file (For 1.12.2, open the zip file and the HTML file should be there, no need to unzip the file either)
If on Windows, it may open a seperate window asking where to open, and it may do this on Mac aswell, and for Chromebook and Linux it should auto-open to your default browser 
If it does not do either, open your files and select the file and drag it over to your browser to open a new tab.


EXTRA INFORMATION AND HELP


How do I transfer worlds between versions?
To transfer worlds between versions, first open the version with the world on it, click "Backup" or "Edit" and there should be a option to download as a vanilla world, click that option. 
Then, go to the desired version, and click create new world, and there should be a option saying "Load EPK file" and "Load vanilla world", click the load vanilla world, and find that file. If neither are there, then sorry but I got no idea, I only had to trasnfer worlds once. 


Can I keep the file downloaded and run it off a USB/Flash drive?
Yes, I use it on my drive all the time on my other devices and you don't leave your files behind on the computer unless the computer has a extension to track all files loaded on the computer, and the file also shows up in your web history. 


Does the game lag a lot? / Why is it lagging so much?
The lag is caused by the device your playing on and maybe if your playing on a drive like above. For example, if your playing on a Chromebook, youll probably be lagging and your average FPS be between 30-50 FPS depending on what your doing. If your on a pretty good computer, you should be okay to run the file. To reduce lag, I turn my render distance down, turn off clouds, turning particals to the minimum and changing most of the visual settings to the minimum. I also usually close a lot of my tabs and programs.
